I built this Price Tracker for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE only.

Clone the repository.  
Install all the dependencies by running npm install.  
Run it locally.  
Paste any amanzon product LINK inside the searchbar.  
Open the terminal in you ide. In my case VSCod.  
It should print the TITLE, CURRENT PRICE, ORIGINAL PRICE(if discount is applied), CURRENCY SYMBOL and DISCOUNT PERCENTAGE.  
  
Make sure to create an account on Bright Data and save the username and pswd inside the .env file and add .env to .gitignore.
