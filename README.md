I built this Price Tracker for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE only.

Clone the repository
Install all the dependencies
Run it locally
Paste any amanzon product LINK inside the searchbar
Open the terminal in you ide. In my case VSCod.
It should print the TITLE, CURRENT PRICE, ORIGINAL PRICE(if discount is applied), CURRECNY SIGN and DISCOUNT PERCENTAGE.
